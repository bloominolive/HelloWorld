# Overview

Hello, World! This is a project that is literally just a quick run through of using Javascript and CSS to make a page with "Hello, World!" on it. 

# Description
I used basic Javascript for this with an index html file that calls it. I used basic CSS as well as Express for my server setup and Node for NPM packages and scripts. 

# Purpose
This was made to ensure I was able to quickly come up with a simple project and get it running to my local machine. It is a good template for a base project.
